A full-stack application where I built both the back-end and front-end from scratch as part of a 16-hour take-home challenge. The project features a RESTful API for managing users, teas, and subscriptions, paired with a React front-end that dynamically displays data. Admins can view and manage user subscriptions, including subscribing and unsubscribing users to specific tea plans. The app allows users to view detailed information on users, teas, and subscriptions, with a user-friendly flow for interacting with the data.
