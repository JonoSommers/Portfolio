Rancid Tomatillos is a collaborative front-end project built with React that allows users to browse a list of movies, vote up or down on titles, and view detailed information about each film. Partnering with another developer, I used React Router to implement advanced routing, built a scalable component architecture, and ensured smooth navigation through Link and NavLink. We thoroughly tested key user stories using Cypress to confirm functionality and reliability. Movie data was pulled from a back-end API, and the app was deployed on Heroku (no longer active due to hosting limitations).
